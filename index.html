        <p>Hello! My name is Erik Grove and this is my programmer portfolio.
            Here I will tell you all about myself and link some of my projects.
        </p>

        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Los Angeles before moving to Washington state in 2012.
            I graduated from South Whidbey High School in 2015.
            I decided to take on this class for a few different reasons.
            The two big reasons are that I wanted to enter a well-paying career, and to pursue my own personal projects;
            coding is an immensely useful skill and it's especially handy for somebody who loves to create like I do.
        </p>
